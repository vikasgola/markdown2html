This markdown has been created by Vikas Gola to know more about him Goto [Vikas Gola](https://vikasgola.github.io/)

1. So what this documentation is?
	This is just a simple tutorial or u can say how to use of markdown language with my code.
	First thing I want to tell u before we start is this documentation is itself **written using this markdown only** 
	with it's powerfull syntax. The synatx for markdown in this documentation is in mostly italic for distinction.
	Now, we can start...

2. **About the code and How to use** - The code for this translator which translates the markdown into html is written in SML. Input for this can be given in function named as 'main' 
	and output file name can be given in SML by making a variable with name _output_ (e.g. _val output = "inputfilename";_ ) or by changing variable "output" inside the code main.sml.
	You can also give the give the csv file input which will auto detected and code will create table for that csv file.
	The separator of csv file for default is '|'. You can also change it your convenience in _main.sml_. 
	<br/>	
	The Code is well commented any one with good knowledge of Standard ML can understand it.
	I mostly tried to build functions specific to their work. The name of functions are mostly relevent or mean to their work.
	They tells what it does.

3. **Bold, Italic and Underline** - You can do any word or phrase in bold style just wrapping it in double star *\*\*like this\*\* *. 
	Similarly to italic any word or phrase just wrape it with single star *\*like this\** and to underline any word or phrase wrap it with underscore *\_like this\_*. 

4. **Paragraph and Blockquote** - Any line of words which are not part of anytype of lists (ordered or unordered)
	surrounded by the at least blank lines will become the paragraph. The blockquotes are which block of lines have indentation more
	from the surroundings and you can make blockquote by using this *>*(greater than sign) in front of each line as a first character.
	You can also use recursive blockquotes which can be used by using more than *>*(greater than sign) in front of line. 
	Please note that you can't use the blockquotes inside lists as it will result into the finishing of list read more about lists in next sections. Examples...<br/>
	\>	this is a example of single blockquote<br/> 
	\>>	this is recursive blockquotes.

5. **Headings** - This markdown provides you the all the power of headings from html. Yes! you can use 6 type of headings
	which have different sizes. Heading can be create by using the \# in any line. As you will increase the number
	\# consecutively size of heading will decrease.
	Examples:-<br/><br/>
	\#\#\#\#\#\# heading with smallest size<br/>
	\#\#\#\#\# bigger than above heading<br/>
	_Will change into:-_ <br/>
	###### heading with smallest size
	##### bigger than above heading
